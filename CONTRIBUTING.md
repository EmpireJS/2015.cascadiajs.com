# How to Contribute to EmpireJS

## Read this document

EmpireJS is a community run conference by web developers for web developers. It has been run by volunteers since its inception in 2012, but has never made it clear how people can participate and contribute to the experience.  Please read this document in its entirety if you're thinking about getting involved. If you have any questions or concerns about this document, please file an issue and we will respond promptly. 

## Join the conversation

There are several channels that the EmpireJS community congregates, please feel free to join any/all of them and spend some time listening and getting to know people. To be honest, things are kind of quiet in between conferences. If you have any ideas on how to keep the conversation going, please let us know!
