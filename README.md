# The EmpireJS Code of Conduct

## The Quick Version

EmpireJS is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable environment for all our participants. We will not tolerate any inappropriate behavior, remarks, images, or online posts. We will not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

All organizers, attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at EmpireJS are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## The Less Quick Version

Everyone - including attendees, sponsors, speakers, and organizers - is required to agree to and follow this Code of Conduct. Inappropriate behavior or harassment of any kind is not tolerated.

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant. This inculdes in our community online, at all related events, and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

EmpireJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference for all attendees, regardless of gender identity, sex, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, physical appearance, or body size. Harassment includes: prejudicial verbal or written comments, sexual imagery in public spaces or inappropriate use of nudity (including in presentation slides), deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sponsors and speakers should not use sexualized or inappropriate images, activities, or other material in their advertisements or talks. Booth staff, including volunteers, should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment. We reserve the right to review all materials and remove them from distribution if they are determined to be inappropriate.

Finally, anything that would make someone think "Hmmm, that's inappropriate" may also be unacceptable behavior.

Any participant asked to stop any harassing behavior is expected to comply immediately. We expect all participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues, as well as conference-related social events.

## Reporting

If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by their STAFF t-shirts. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

## Enforcement

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate; this may inculde warning the participant, immediate expulsion from the conference without refund. Our foremost concern is the safety and comfort of all our particpants.
